# VPN Connection Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing protocol or protocol has invalid type**: This error occurred because the VPN configuration was not properly set up with a valid `NETunnelProviderProtocol` configuration that the extension expects.

2. **Permission denied**: This error happened when the app didn't have proper VPN permissions or when there was a corrupted VPN configuration.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Saved VPN configuration to Keychain**: Added the server configuration (chinida.space:443 with password fuyilee) to the Keychain so the app can load it on startup.

2. **Set up proper VPN manager configuration**: Configured the `NEVPNManager` with a `NETunnelProviderProtocol` that matches what the extension expects:
   - Correct bundle identifier: `com.trojanvpn.TrojanVPNExtension`
   - Proper server address: `chinida.space`
   - Valid configuration parameters including SNI

3. **Cleared any existing broken configuration**: Removed any corrupted VPN configuration that might have been causing issues.

## Testing Instructions

1. **Restart the TrojanVPN app**: Close the app completely and reopen it.

2. **Check the server profile**: You should now see "Chinida Space Server" in your server list.

3. **Connect to the VPN**: 
   - Click the "Connect" button
   - If prompted for permissions, approve the VPN connection in System Preferences

4. **If you still get permission errors**:
   - Go to System Preferences > Network
   - Click the lock icon and enter your password
   - Find TrojanVPN in the list and click '-' to remove it
   - Restart the app and try connecting again

## Additional Notes

- The configuration is now properly stored in the Keychain for persistence
- The app should automatically load this configuration on startup
- The VPN extension should now receive the correct protocol configuration

If you continue to experience issues, please check:
1. That the app is properly signed with Network Extension entitlements
2. That the extension bundle identifier matches in both the app and extension
3. That you're using a physical device (Network Extensions don't work in Simulator)
